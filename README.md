# fizzbuzz
An implementation of the FizzBuzz problem

## JavaScript version

I have included 2 versions for the JavaScript implementation. The first one outputs basic strings each on a new line. The second one puts everything in an array and outputs that array.

The easiest way to run the scripts is with Node.

### Strings

```
node js/fizzBuzz.js
```

### Array

```
node js/fizzBuzzArray.js
```
